# Messaging Web App

This project was created to learn and strengthen my knowledge in ReactJS, HTML and CSS. This project's website can be accessed at [messagingbytetrerox.netlify.app](https://messagingbytetrerox.netlify.app). You would have to log in via a google account to use the application.

Here is the tech stack that I used:
* Frontend
  - ReactJS
  - HTML
  - CSS
* Backend
  - Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service
  - Firebase Auth for authentication
  - Firebase Firestore for the database (NoSQL)
